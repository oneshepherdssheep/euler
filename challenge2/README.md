# Even fibonacci numbers

## Description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br>
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br>
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.<br>

## Understanding

For this one, we have to compute the Fibonacci numbers which are less than four million,<br>
for each one of them find out if they are even and if it is the case perform a summation.<br>

That's not so difficult, but the difficulty resides in the computation of Fibonacci numbers. <br>
Usually we use recursive function to do that. However, if we have to do that for all numbers, <br>
it will have a huge cost.

The first solution which came to my mind was to have a caching system so that as we are computing <br>
Fibonacci numbers, we may cache them along the way, so that the recursive function could use some <br>
cached values instead of always going to a recursive branch which may have been explored already <br>
for another computation. <br>
