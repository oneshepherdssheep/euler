# ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

The Euler Project is very useful project to help us go beyond our normal day to day programming activities
(unless you are working on research projects). So because of the benefits we get from working on those
amazing challenges, I do not suggest that you check those solutions **UNLESS** you have already figured out the 
solution by yourself.

I publish my solutions to show my understanding and approaches when dealing with each challenge.

So, you have been warned.

# Project Euler

My solutions to the euler project challenges (https://projecteuler.net) implemented in C++.

For each challenge, I give:
- description of the challenge as described on their website
- my understanding of the challenge : how I understood it and what I did to make it work (equations, mathematical properties etc.)
- implementation/solution for the challenge
